# Typescript websocket server

I've created this app during a coding challenge in 2020.

It's a simple application with websocket to schedule events and dispatch for connected users.

Created in 2 hours using socket.io and mocha with chai for unit tests

To start the server
------------

1.  Run ```npm test``` test the server communication
2.  Run ```npm start``` to start the server

Check the unit tests to see in action and to understand this application
